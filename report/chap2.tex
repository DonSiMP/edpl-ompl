\chapter{Issues \& Notes}

\section{Notes}

OMPLâ€™s API is very different programmatically and philosophically from PMPL. Due to its lightweight nature, OMPL does not depend 
external libraries (except BOOST) which gives it a disadvantage in terms of extra functionality (such as reading setup parameters from XML files etc.).

\subsection{How the OMPL PRM planner works}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Call \textit{setProblemDefinition} to define the parameters of the problem.
 \item Call \textit{setup} to setup the planners specific internals like validity checker etc.
 \item  Call \textit{solve} to find construct graph and find a solutions:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Call \textit{checkValidity} : makes sure start and goal states have been set
    \item set termination conditions
    \item Call \textit{constructRoadMap}: 
	    \begin{itemize}
	     \item Allocates a simple state sampler
	     \item Calls \textit{growRoadmap} and \textit{expandRoadmap} in a 2:1 ratio
	     

	    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}

 \item \textit{addMilestone} : 
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item  Adds a state to the graph and creates a vertex with the properties and everything else. 
   \item After creating the vertex, it attempts to connect the vertex to its nearest neighbours
   \item during the connection, it finds the motion cost associated with the connection. \color{red}{This is the point where we run the monte carlo simulation to generate edge costs}
  \end{enumerate}

 \item \textit{growRoadmap}: Takes as input a termination condition and a state, samples a valid state and puts it in input state and adds it to the graph.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Issues}
Log of issues faced and discussions on their solutions.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Should the optimization functionality in OMPL Planner class be used or should the planner be implemented straight forward, similar to PMPL approach ?
    \begin{itemize}
     \item 
    \end{itemize}
\item How to add the properties of an edge to the graph i.e. EdgeController; a) Create a hashtable which maps from edge to controller id, b) store the edge controller as the property of an edge i.e. create a custom edge property. Easier approach would be to (a).
\end{enumerate}
